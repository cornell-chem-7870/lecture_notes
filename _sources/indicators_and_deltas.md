To manipulate probabilites of events and help us calculate conditional probabilities, we often use indicator functions and delta functions.  The indicator function is a function that takes a value and returns 1 if the value is in a set and 0 otherwise.  The indicator function is often denoted by $1_A(x)$ and is defined as

$$
1_A(x) = \begin{cases}
1 & \text{if } x \in A, \\
0 & \text{otherwise}.
\end{cases}
$$

The indicator function links probabilities with expectations: $E[1_A(x)] = P(A)$.  Moreover, products of indicator functions represent intersection of events: $E[1_A(x)1_B(x)] = P(A \cap B)$, the probability that both $A$ and $B$ occur.\
